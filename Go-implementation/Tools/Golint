Golint is a tool that checks for styles mistakes in the go codebase.

For example, it’ll report you when a public method doesn’t have any comment. If there is a comment, it reports if you don’t follow the best practice. If you wrote a method called newJsonData(), it’ll report you that it is a better practice to write newJSONData(), and so on.


Here is the link to download golint https://github.com/golang/lint or follow the steps below.
